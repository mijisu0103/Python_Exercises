    "Go back to your game of Lingo program. Create a class ```Secret``` that holds the secret word (that should be passed to the constructor). The class should provide three Boolean methods: ```check_contains``` that takes a letter as its argument and returns ```True``` if it is contained in the secret, ```False``` otherwise. Method ```check_position``` should take a letter and a position and return ```True``` if the letter of the secret at the specified position is equal to the letter you have passed, ```False``` otherwise. Finally, ```check_equals``` should take the entire user guess and return ```True``` if it is equal to the secret, ```False``` otherwise. You can also code a method ```length``` that returns the length of the secret. Refactor your code so that it uses the ```Secret``` class.\n"
