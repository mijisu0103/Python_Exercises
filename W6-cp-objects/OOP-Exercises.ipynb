    "* Class ```FarmAnimal``` extends ```Animal```. It adds a method ```to_stable``` that prints the message \"Taking NAME to the stables\", as appropriate.\n",
    "* Class ```Pet``` extends ```Animal```. It adds an attribute ```is_sociable``` that is either ```True``` or ```False```; this attribute must be set by the constructor. It also adds a ```pet``` method that prints the message \"I'm petting NAME\" or \"NAME does not like to be petted\" according to the value of ```is_sociable```. \n",
    "* Classes ```Cow``` and ```Goat``` extend ```FarmAnimal```; classes ```Cat```, ```Dog``` and ```Python``` extend ```Pet```. Each of them defines a method ```make_sound``` that takes an integer as its argument and prints the sound that animal makes the corresponding number of times. \n",

    "* Create a list of all your pets. Write a loop that pets them.\n",
    "* Merge the two lists. Write a loop that, for each animal, calls ```basic_info``` to get the name and age of the animal, prints the message \"NAME just turned AGE and says:\" and then calls ```make_sound``` with the value of the age. So for instance if the cat is 4, it should go \"meow\" four times.\n",
    "* Optional: Add an attribute ```sound``` to ```Animal```, and have it set by the constructor. Move the ```make_sound``` code to the class ```Animal```, and modify it so that it uses the ```sound``` attribute to print the correct sound. Remove ```make_sound``` from the derived classes. You will need to change the constructor of the derived classes and the lines that create your animals accordingly, but in the end your code will be much shorter.\n",
